This repository is a home for my Dealls CEO Office assignment. <br>
The outcome was **REJECTED**, but I successfully passed the **CV Screening** phase despite this outcome. 
<br>
<br>
Here, you will learn about my writing sample for the CEO Office Role (which I assumed would groom me into a Product Manager as revealed by the assessment) tasks such as:
1. Project Documentation,
2. Product Design, and
3. Resource Allocations.
